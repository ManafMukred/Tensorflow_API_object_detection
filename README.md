# Rock-Paper-Scissor object_detection using tensorflow API


# Overview

This project is an object detection and localization using Object Detection API with TensorFlow 2 where we used a dataset of three classes: Rock, Paper, and Scissor. We annotated and labeled the images to prepare for training, then used two different pre-trained models to compare performances. Models used are: SSD **MobileNet_v2_320x320** and **efficientdet_d0_coco17_tpu_32**, both models were trained for 2000 epochs.

# Code:

The **project_RPS.ipynb** notebook is divided into 3 sections:

1.   ### Data preprocessing 
2.   ### Training
3.   ### Evaluation
